- Enchants the "funstick" with a glowing effect.
- Switchable effects **(new! - only with v1.1.3)**

## Installation

2. Place the downloaded `.jar` file into the `plugins` folder of your Minecraft server.
3. Restart or reload the server.

## Usage

- Obtain the "funstick" in-game by renaming a blazerod to "funstick" using an anvil.
